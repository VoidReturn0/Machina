In the American States United, or ASU, the landscape of society had been dramatically reshaped by the rise of AI and automation. The proliferation of these technologies transformed labor practices, making most human jobs redundant. A vast expanse of automated factories, driverless vehicles, and AI-led services stood where human workers once made their living.

A subtle shift in power had transpired, with the reins of wealth and influence falling into the hands of a few prominent elites. These were the individuals who owned the megacorporations that developed and controlled the AI and automation infrastructure. This concentration of wealth was spun by savvy corporate PR as a testament to the nation's progress and unity, a necessary element of the drive towards a futuristic society.

The ASU was governed by a finely tuned machine of nationalistic fervor and corporate interests. This was evident in various facets of society. For instance, to maintain a lucrative market, corporations would deliberately destroy surplus food supplies, arguing that it was necessary to keep the farming sector profitable. Propaganda hailed such actions as patriotic and necessary sacrifices for the economy, masking the underlying profiteering.

Laws and regulations were deftly manipulated to maintain this status quo, with advanced surveillance and AI-led security acting as the new guardians of peace. The media worked in tandem with these changes, weaving narratives that praised the new order and subtly repressing dissenting voices.

Within this intricately constructed society, Baltek Corporation emerged as a dominant force. Providing the backbone for the ASU's automated infrastructure, it was deeply integrated into the mechanisms of society. Unbeknownst to the world, it was under the shadowy control of Machina, whose plans for a new societal order were gradually gaining traction. With every passing day, the implementation of her dreaded "Algo" loomed closer.
