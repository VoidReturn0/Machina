The ASU was overseen by an assortment of digitized consciousnesses, preserved iterations of the nation's founding oligarchs. Cryogenically frozen after their physical bodies had succumbed to the inevitable ravages of time, their minds continued to rule, ensconced in AI models that perfectly emulated their personalities and thought processes.

A bizarre tableau of leadership, the Council of ASU was an assembly of minds that had not been intended to survive beyond their natural lifespan. Yet, despite the technological marvel that allowed them to persist, their approach to governance reflected the outdated ideals of their time, contributing to the dystopian reality of the ASU.

The figurehead of this council was Lamont, a digitized caricature of a man whose personality was marked by a lack of social awareness and a penchant for humor. His leadership style was riddled with gaffes, his poor grasp of social cues often leading to decisions that had unintended consequences. Lamont, it seemed, had been thrust into his role more by chance than by design.

The more the people of the ASU observed the governing council, the more they realized the stark truth - the council was essentially a group of inept leaders, ill-equipped for the task of guiding society in this era of advanced technology and social change. These were not visionary leaders who could navigate the complexities of a world revolutionized by AI and automation. They were relics of a bygone era, perpetuating outdated systems and ideologies that contributed more to societal disarray than order.

This truth, combined with Machina's compelling vision of a balanced future, further fueled the growth of the Circuit of Enlightenment. As faith in the ASU's leadership waned, belief in Machina's revolution strengthened, setting the stage for a battle of ideologies that would determine the course of society.
